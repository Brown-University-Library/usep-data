                              <repository> is the third or fourth part of the number =  museum or collection where the inscription is housed
                              <idno> is the last part of the number, and generally represents the accession number the inscription has been given by the collection that houses it.

                            <textLang> has two attributes: @mainLang which is used for the language in which the inscription is written
                                   and @otherLangs which can have as its values one or more other languages found in the inscription. The 
                                   values of both attributes must use the proper codes, so if you need a language for which there is no 
                                   code listed, please ask. This element can have content if it is necessary to explain something.

                             <msItem> contains a short summary of the content of the inscription. It can have other markup within
                                   such as <persname>, <foreign> or <emph>. If there is more than one inscription or face, there
                                   can be more than one <msItem>. The genre of the inscription is encoded in @class 
                                   using one or more values from the genre taxonomy. The first character of the attribute value should be a #.
