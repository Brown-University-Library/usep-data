                                    <p>The kouros is generally in good condition. Six parallel
                                        incisions on the underside of the plinth seem to have been
                                        created with some sort of modern tool. Two modern
                                        screw-holes in the bottom of the plinth have been filled
                                        with clear glue or plastic, while one screw-hole
                                        accidentally created a hole in the front of the right ankle.
                                        Two small holes on diagonally opposite corners of the
                                        plinth, of somewhat irregular form and larger than the
                                        screw-holes likely fixed the kouros to some sort of larger
                                        object. The arms were either made separately from the body
                                        and joined, or part of the body but subsequently broken and
                                        then mended. An ultraviolet examination by the MFA (also in
                                        1944) discovered that the figure had undergone a drastic
                                        cleaning which had damaged the bronze; a green patina
                                        consisting of wax and green pigment was removed during this
                                        inspection, also containing malachite with a cuprous oxide

                                <p>The kouros stands nude in a rigid, upright pose. It has
                                    conventionalized, simple features. The head is turned
                                    forwards, with wavy, schematized hair falling to the
                                    shoulders. The face displays the 'archaic smile.' The body
                                    displays continuous contours rather than schematically
                                    incised linear divisions. The arms fall perpendicular,
                                    parallel to the body, slightly bent. The hands have hollow
                                    spots which once held some sort of implement such as spears,
                                    arrows or reins for an implied chariot. The left foot is
                                    advanced about half a foot length ahead of the right foot.

                <p>Line 1: ϝεκαβόλοι: the digamma survives much longer in dialects besides Attic-Ionic and
                    Lesbian. It survives longest of all in initial position before a vowel, where it
                    preserved in some dialects into the 2nd cent. BCE. Long alpha: Boeotian has no
                    eta, so alpha represents long and short α, as it also does in the fem. gen.
                    sing. article τὰς and the fem. gen. sing. ending δεκάτας; the same situation
                    applies to epsilon, which represents long-ē in the second ε of ἀνέθεκεν. Long
                    final omicron, omega is not found in the Boeotian dialect. The kouros dedicated by Mantiklos (700-675 BCE), to which the present
                    kouros has often been compared, also uses this word in this case and form
                    (Μάντικλος μ’ἀνέθεκεν Ϝεκαβόλοι) as does a Laconian lebes. In his study of the
                    kouroi at Ptoion, Ducat notes that this epithet is not used as an epithet of
                    Apollo.</p>
                <p>Line 2: δεκάτης is a partitive genitive (sc. Ἀμφίας τοῦτο τὸ ἄγαλμα ἐκ τῆς
                    δεκάτης ἀνέθηκεν). Ducat notes that in the
                    dedications at Ptoion the inscriptions do not mention a tithe.</p>
                <p>Metre:
                    the first half (left leg) is a trochee, while the second half is a dactyl or
                    pentameter: -u/-u/-u || -uu/-uu/-u.</p>
                <p>Based on the letter forms and the language,
                    the inscription is thought to be Boeotian in dialect, with some irregularities.
                    The 5 bar sigma occurs here for all three sigmas, which is not known in archaic
                    Boeotian, which uses the 4 or 3 bar sigma. The 5 bar sigma would be normal for
                    Laconian of the period, but the alpha and lambda in the present inscription
                    cannot be Laconian. The dotted theta is also unusual for archaic Boeotian: it
                    appears late, around 500 BCE - it may be noted in connection that Merritt
                    assessed the inscription's date (ignoring the form of the figure) to 500 BCE.
                    Finally, the nu ephelkuetikon (attracted to the end of the word) in archaic
                    Boeotian seems to be unattested at the end of a sentence in with ἀνέθεκε or
                    ἐποίεσε. The rest of the letter-forms conform to Boeotian practice. </p>
