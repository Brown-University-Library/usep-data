                              <institution> is optional, but is used if there is a university or other entity to which the collection belongs
                              <repository> is the third or fourth part of the number =  museum or collection where the inscription is housed
                              <idno> is the last part of the number, and generally represents the accession number the inscription has been given by the collection that houses it. 
                              It should correspond to the last component of <title>.

                                   and @otherLangs which can have as its values one or more other languages found in the inscription. The 
                                   values of both attributes must use the proper codes, so if you need a language for which there is no

                                   such as <persname>, <foreign> or <emph>. If there is more than one inscription or face, there
                                   can be more than one <msItem>. Ex: Epitaph of young woman.
                                   The genre of the inscription is encoded in @class 
                                   using one or more values from the genre taxonomy. The first character of the attribute value should be a #.

            This section of the header contains the controlled vocabularies for the genre, form and material of
            an inscription. The taxonomies are in external files, but as you work, Oxygen is reading them, and can 
            validate ids so that you can be assured that you are using correct values.
            
            If you don't find the value you need, you should talk to the project manager or John Bodel, in order to see 
            what value to use, or (rarely) whether the taxonomies need to be modified.
            
            Encoders do not edit the <encodingDesc>.
