                        and spells each part out.
                              <region> corresponds to the first part of the number = state
                              <settlement> corresponds to the second part = city
                              <institution> is optional, but is used if there is a university or other entity to which the collection belongs
                              <repository> is the third or fourth part of the number =  museum or collection where the inscription is housed
                              <idno> is the last part of the number, and generally represents the accession number the inscription has been given by the collection that houses it. 
                              It should correspond to the last component of <title>.
                              
                              If there is more repository information, or if the inscription is known by another name, this information can
                              be encoded using <altIdentifer>, which has the same elements as <msIdentifier>, or by <msName>, which contains text.

                            <textLang> has two attributes: @mainLang which is used for the language in which the inscription is written
                                   and @otherLangs which can have as its values one or more other languages found in the inscription. The 
                                   values of both attributes must use the proper codes, so if you need a language for which there is no 
                                   code listed, please ask. if there are two languages, the element will look like this:
                                   <textLang mainLang="xx" otherLangs="yy"/>
                                   
                             <msItem> contains a short summary of the content of the inscription. It can have other markup within
                                   such as <persname>, <foreign> or <emph>. If there is more than one inscription or face, there
                                   can be more than one <msItem>. Ex: Epitaph of young woman.
                                   The genre of the inscription is encoded in @class 
                                   using one or more values from the genre taxonomy. The first character of the attribute value should be a #.
