                            <textLang> has two attributes: @mainLang which is used for the language in which the inscription is written
                                   and @otherLangs which can have as its values one or more other languages found in the inscription. The 
                                   values of both attributes must use the proper codes, so if you need a language for which there is no 
                                   code listed, please ask. This element can have content if it is necessary to explain something.

                             <msItem> contains a short summary of the content of the inscription. It can have other markup within
                                   such as <persname>, <foreign> or <emph>. If there is more than one inscription or face, there
                                   can be more than one <msItem>. The genre of the inscription is encoded in @class 
                                   using one or more values from the genre taxonomy. The first character of the attribute value should be a #.

        Used to point to images of an inscription. 
          <graphic> (directly within <facsimile>) Use this if there is only a single "main" image without a special caption.
          <surface> Use <desc> and <graphic> within <surface> if there are mutiple images or if they have captions. <surface>
          pairs one or more images with a single caption. Usually, in US Ep. captions are only indicated when the image is of a detail.
          @url contains the name of the image file (no path or directory information, for now).
        <facsimile> can have more than one <graphic> or <surface>.
