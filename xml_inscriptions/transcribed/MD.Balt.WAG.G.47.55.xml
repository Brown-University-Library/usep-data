                <p>“Seize the victory.” The nu of “τὴν” is
                    reversed, an easy enough mistake to make when carving letters into a mold, into
                    which the glass would then have been blown. This backwards nu is rather common
                    in glass cups of this sort, however, and it may be a sort of stylistic mirroring
                    of ‘N’s, one at the end of “τὴν” and the other at the beginning of “νείκην,”
                    separated by the palm fronds which conceal the marks where the two pieces of the
                    mold came together. “νείκην” is not classical Attic Greek, but it is a common
                    enough Koine spelling of “νίκην,” and most “Seize the victory cups” use this
                    form (“νείκην”), although “νίκην” is also found. This phrase and a very similar
                    iconography was evidently common on glass drinking cups, particularly in Syria,
                    Cyprus, and the Black Sea area (see the works listed under “Type parallels” in
                    the bibliography, of which there are several and the colors of the glass found
                    range from greens and yellow to browns and purples), and it was in Syria,
                    Palestine, and Phoenicia, in the first century CE, that mold-blown glass
                    exploded in popularity (and, even if it was not discovered there, as is
                    probable, the art certainly reached new heights of refinement along the coasts
                    of Roman provinces in the area). This glass almost certainly has its origin in
                    first half of first-century-CE Syria-Palestine or Cyprus, and may have been made
                    in Sidon, near which three close parallels to this cup were found (Stern 98f,
                    no. 2, pl. 2, no. 3, pl. 3, no. 4, pl. 4), two of which (no. 3 and 4) even
                    contain the backwards nu in the word “τὴν,” as well as nearly identical
                    decoration and lettering. A few cups from a series from Cyprus have also been
                    found with a backwards nu in “τὴν.” There appear to be at least four distinct
                    series of “Seize the victory” cups, and this example fits most closely in
                    Harden’s group “K1iii,” although Harden’s 1935 list and Stern’s updated 1995
                    catalogue do not include this particular cup. In addition to the argument that
                    cups of this sort were given out as victory prizes—Perdrizet argues that they
                    may have been filled first with money and then distributed to winners—Stern
                    suggests that they may have been crafted for drinking contests, since some
                    “Seize the victory” cups likewise contain the inscription “εἰσελθών” (LSJ II,
                    “enter the lists, in a contest.”) Although it is, indeed, possible that the
                    inscriptions on these cups refer to drinking contests, suggesting that the
                    addition of the participle “εἰσελθών” strengthens this assertion makes little
                    sense. Their popularity and level of distribution, however, do lend feasibility
                    to Stern’s theory, and it is difficult to imagine that there were enough
                    contests to give out so many glasses of this type (and similar types) as prizes,
