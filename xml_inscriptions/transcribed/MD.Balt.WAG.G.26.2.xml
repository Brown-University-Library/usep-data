            <p> l. 4: “εὐψύχι” is a very common form of “εὐψύχει,”
                    found throughout Egypt, Nubia, and Cyrenaica. Although both are attested, the
                    former is roughly twice as common as the latter, based on my own review of the
                    corpus. The lettering is typical of Hellenistic and Imperial Greek inscriptions.
                   Interpuncts are employed somewhat irregularly.  Many of the carved lines of both the
                    decoration and the lettering of this inscription are rather rough, and it is
                    difficult to determine whether this is the result of wear over time or of the
                    carver’s technique. It is unusual to find the name of the deceased in the
                    accusative, with the imperative “εὐψύχι,” which is usually found in Egypt with
                    the deceased’s name in the vocative or nominative, but it is not without
                    parallel (E.g. “Τιβέριον Κλ|αύδιον Ἀγαθ|ὸν. εὐψ[ύ]χι.” (SB 1.5038 = Breccia,
                    Alexandria Mus. 377); SEG 52:1811). Weir suggested that this stele belonged to
                    Syrian Antioch, rather than Egypt, based on his own comparison of its
                    similarities in size, material, iconography, style, and lettering with the
                    stelai from Antioch which are now found in the Art Museum of Princeton, an
                    interpretation which has been challenged and cast into much doubt by Tybout, who
                    sees very little similarity beyond that which can be found throughout the
                    inscriptions of the Greek world from the time of the Roman empire. (SEG 52:1811;
                    for Weir’s analysis, see: SEG 52:1548; R.G.A.Weir in J.M.Padgett (ed.), Roman
                    Sculpture in the Art Museum, Princeton University (Princeton 2001) 276, note 1.)
                    The iconography, paleography, and style of the
                    stele fully support this third century CE date, and it may even be from the
                    fourth century. Her father’s lack of a Roman praenomen in this inscription is
                    worth noting, and may suggest that he was not himself a Roman citizen, pushing
                    the date of this inscription closer to 212 CE. This argument from silence is
                    weak, however, and the inscription’s reference to Aurelia Artemis’ father as
                    Pasion may be based in personal taste and fashion. </p></div>
            <div type="translation">
                <p>“Aurelia Artemis, daughter of Pasion, the sweetest, without comparison among all:
                    farewell.”</p>
