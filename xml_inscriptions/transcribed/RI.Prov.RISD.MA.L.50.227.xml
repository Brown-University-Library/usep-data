                                    pattern, a rinceaux motif (continuous wavy foliage), and then

                                    more. The missing corner is thought to have ended in an ornate
                                    palmette-motif. Drilling is used frequently for the rinceaux and
                                    bread-and-reel patterns, but not for the Lesbian leaf.</p>

                <!-- notes go here -->
                <p>Based on what little survives, we have evidence of one column of text in at least
                    two lines. The S has slight damage to its curving s-stroke, top or bottom
                    depending on one's interpretations, but the letter is still easily recognizable.
                    The marble breaks off so close to the S that we have no trace of a prior letter
                    or even a slight amount of empty space. On the other side of the letter is the
                    blank space of the campus: the text originally started or ended here. The other
                    letter above or below it has what appears to be a slanting stroke that ends with
                    a pronounced, curved seriph. Based on a close inspection of Ridgway's photo,
                    there appears to be the remains of a crossbar connected to the slanting stroke,
                    such as on an A (or perhaps an H). Ridgway does not mention the crossbar and
                    suggests that this letter could be an A or V, depending on orientation of the
                    inscription we accept.</p>
                <p> Speaking very generally, the paleography of this
                    letter appears to be of a mid/late Republican to high imperial date,
                    for there is clear evidence of shading (gradation of depth and
                    breadth in the incised stroke) and pronounced serifs. The uniform
                    shapes of the curves in the curves of the s-stroke offer no help in
                    determining the orientation of the inscription. However, the serif
                    on the side of the letter closest to the border has a straight 90
                    degree angle to it, while the serif of the other end is curved
                    slightly.</p>
